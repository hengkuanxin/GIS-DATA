# GIS-DATA
Repository for data sets used in SMT201 GIS Project.

This repository will be used to store project data sets for collaborative use between the project team members only.
Data sets include raw data as well as derived data, such as GeoPackages or GeoTIFF files from the QGIS application.

Feel free to upload and download the data sets directly onto and from the repository.

**For good organisation of data, please create a new subfolder for each data set.**
